# Clustering-of-Countries
This project consists of different Clustering algorithms to cluster countries based on child mortality, exports,  health, imports etc into developed or developing countries

## What is Clustering in Machine Learning?

A Clustering algorithm is a type of Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm which groups unlabelled dataset into different clusters based on the similarity in data points through various features of dataset.

## Different Clustering techniques:

* k-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Fuzzy Analysis Clustering
* Mean Shift Clustering
* DBSCAN â€“ Density-based Spatial Clustering
* Gaussian Mixed Models (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization Clustering

## Where is Clustering used:

* In movie recommendation systems for Netflix where a huge amount of data consisting of different movies watched by the customers are available. The algorithm groups customers with similar interest and movies that people with that interest have watched is suggested to the other users.
* It is used in image segmentation in bioinformatics to detect cancerous cells in the body, overcoming many possible human errors.
* Grouping documents to prevent spread of fake news on Social Media
* Text clustering: In academics, clustering can be used in the associative analysis of various documents which is used in plagiarism, copyright infringement, patent analysis etc

## This dataset consists different features which help identifying the level of a country in this developing world!

The different features and their description are:

All the columns, except for the first, country name, will help clustering the countries.

The algorithms used will be K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
The models will be trained with the dataset and the best model will be used to cluster and visualize the dataset.
